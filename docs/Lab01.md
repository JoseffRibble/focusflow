# Lab 01

## Codebase
We are going to use Django to manage the database and frontend as we are all pretty familar with Python and Joseff has used Django during his internship. PostgreSQL for the database because we are familiar with SQL and Postgres specifically. Django makes using SQL and Python easy.

## Project management
We are going to use GitHub's project system to manage tasks and issues. Tasks can be created and assigned to users using a Kanban board.
